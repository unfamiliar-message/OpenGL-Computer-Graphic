# 3D Model Rendering Engine

This project is a 3D model rendering engine designed to load and display detailed 3D models with realistic materials and lighting.

## Core Capabilities

* **Advanced Model & Material Loading:** Efficiently loads 3D models in OBJ format, including their associated material properties and texture images defined in MTL files. Models with multiple materials are fully supported.
* **Optimized Geometry Handling:** Complex model geometry is handled efficiently through the use of index buffers and automatic triangulation of polygons, leading to improved rendering performance.
* **Realistic Shading & Lighting:** The engine implements per-fragment ambient, diffuse, and specular shading, enhanced by the use of diffuse textures and spot lights, to create visually compelling results.
* **Model Normalization:** Loaded models are automatically centered and scaled to a consistent size, simplifying scene management and ensuring uniform presentation.

This engine provides a solid framework for rendering visually rich 3D scenes with optimized performance and ease of use.
