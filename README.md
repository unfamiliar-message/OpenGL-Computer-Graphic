# 3D Model Rendering Engine

This project is a 3D model rendering engine designed to load and display detailed 3D models with realistic materials and lighting.

## Core Capabilities

* **Advanced Model & Material Loading:** Efficiently loads 3D models in OBJ format, including their associated material properties and texture images defined in MTL files. Models with multiple materials are fully supported.
* **Optimized Geometry Handling:** Complex model geometry is handled efficiently through the use of index buffers and automatic triangulation of polygons, leading to improved rendering performance.
* **Realistic Shading & Lighting:** The engine implements per-fragment ambient, diffuse, and specular shading, enhanced by the use of diffuse textures and spot lights, to create visually compelling results.
* **Model Normalization:** Loaded models are automatically centered and scaled to a consistent size, simplifying scene management and ensuring uniform presentation.
* **Texture Mapping:** The engine now supports diffuse textures, allowing images to be applied to the surfaces of objects, adding intricate visual detail. The rendering pipeline efficiently passes texture coordinates and samples textures during the shading process.
This engine provides a solid framework for rendering visually rich 3D scenes with optimized performance and ease of use.
